# Brain Stroke Prediction Model

## Introduction:
Brain strokes are a leading cause of disability and death worldwide, significantly impacting patients' lives. The early identification of risk factors is crucial in preventing strokes and improving outcomes. This project aims to apply data mining techniques to analyze a dataset of patient information related to brain strokes. By identifying patterns and key predictors, we seek to develop models that can effectively predict the likelihood of stroke, thereby assisting in early intervention and risk reduction strategies.

## Project Motivations: 
Recently, the incidence of brain strokes has been on the rise, becoming increasingly common among individuals. This condition can lead to severe health complications, including death. In our project, we will study and analyze patients' data to identify possible factors and risks that contribute to brain strokes. By understanding these risk factors, we aim to help individuals take preventive measures by predicting the likelihood of experiencing a brain stroke.
